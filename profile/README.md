_Wouldn't it be nice if you could keep the environment while jogging for your health?_

### The problem of modern people's lack of exercise

> Modern people are suffering from a severe lack of exercise due to their busy lives. According to the WHO data, the analysis, citing data from 194 countries, revealed that the additional medical expenses incurred by those who do not engage in physical activity amount to $27.4 billion per year. It is predicted that there will be 500 million cases of non-communicable diseases or mental illness that can be prevented by insufficient physical activity by 2030.

### The problem of street waste

> In modern society, problems related to waste disposal are causing many problems. In particular, waste on the streets takes a lot of human resources and time to clean up, and those that have not been cleaned up are causing environmental pollution. This is making the problem of lowering the recycling rate even harder for the planet suffering from waste.

<br>

Our team TrashWouldBe decided to encourage people to do an environmental movement called plogging as a solution that can solve these two problems at once, and we approached it through the experience of raising cute pet.
